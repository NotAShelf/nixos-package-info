# 🔍 nixos-package-info

> Tools and collections around parsing Nixpkgs package data

## 🎛️ Usage

**nixos-package-info** generates a JSON database for the latest nixpkgs commit every hour. The database contains **package_name**, **package_version** and
**package_description** by default. The `--full` flag can be used to display **package_longDescription** and **package_homepage** in addition.

The database is intended to be parsed by third party tools, possibly to replace the undesirable interface of `nix search`. No assumptions are made about
the formatting of output files, and parsing is left entirely to the user's discretion.

### Example Data

This is an example package field, generated without the `--full` command.

```json
{
  "package_description": "A simple terminal UI for both docker and docker-compose",
  "package_name": "lazydocker",
  "package_version": "0.23.1"
}
```

The raw output can be parsed with `jq` to be more human-readable.

## 📦 Packages

The repository contains several packages, each with their own purpose. Below is an explanation of each package.

### update-sources

Updates the Nixpkgs revision in `data/target.json`. The `target.json` file is used by the [flake-info](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-search/tree/main/flake-info)
tool to generate raw Nixpkgs data.

#### Usage

```bash
nix run .#update-sources data/targets.json
```

### nixos-package-info

The main tool of this flake, it uses data generated by `flake-info` to generate a much smaller database with relevant package info.
By default, it returns package name, version and description. Using the `--full` flag will also return long description and the package
homepage.

#### Usage

Generate lightweight database

```console
nix run .#nixos-package-info -- --input data/nixpkgs.json > database.json
```

Generate full database

```console
nix run .#nixos-package-info -- --full --input data/nixpkgs.json > database-full.json
```
